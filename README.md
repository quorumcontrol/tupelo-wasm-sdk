# Tupelo Wasm SDK

V2 of the tupelo-js-sdk is a standalone SDK that works with wasm to talk directly to the Tupelo network and does not require a rpc server.

Note: in the words of IPFS: this project is still in Alpha, lots of development is happening, API might change, beware of the Dragons üêâ.

See https://docs.quorumcontrol.com/ for an overview of Tupelo, the whitepaper, other SDKs, etc. For a high-level walkthrough see this video: https://youtu.be/4Oz03l9IQPc which uses the [Tupelo ChainTree Explorer](https://github.com/quorumcontrol/wasm-explorer) described below.

## Examples
We have a comprehensive collection of examples in the *examples/* directory, which should
help you get up to speed quickly on various aspects of the SDK.

## Tupelo ChainTree Explorer
We have made a main demo app based on the SDK, the 
[Tupelo ChainTree Explorer](https://github.com/quorumcontrol/wasm-explorer). This lets you explore
ChainTrees in the Tupelo testnet, and should be a great reference for learning how to use
the Tupelo Wasm SDK in depth!

## API
See: [https://quorumcontrol.github.io/tupelo-wasm-sdk/docs/tupelo-wasm-sdk.html](https://quorumcontrol.github.io/tupelo-wasm-sdk/docs/tupelo-wasm-sdk.html)

## Getting Started

The following snippet of code is all you need to send a transaction to our Testnet

```js
const sdk = require('tupelo-wasm-sdk')

// setup a connection to the default community and Tupelo TestNet
const community = await sdk.Community.getDefault() 

// Generate a new public/private keypair
const key = await sdk.EcdsaKey.generate() 

// Create a new empty tree with the new keypair
const tree = await sdk.ChainTree.newEmptyTree(community.blockservice, key) 

// Play a transaction on the TestNet
let resp = await community.playTransactions(tree, [sdk.setDataTransaction("path", true)])

// Congrats on making a DLT transaction
```

You can also find ChainTrees by their DID and resolve data on them, easily:

```js
const sdk = require('tupelo-wasm-sdk')

// setup a connection to the default community and Tupelo TestNet
const community = await sdk.Community.getDefault() 

const tip = await community.getTip("did:tupelo:0xD1a9826f3A06d393368C9949535De802A35cD6b2")

const tree = new ChainTree({
   store: community.blockservice,
   tip: tip,
})

const [remaining,value] = await tree.resolve(["tree", "data", "path"])

// remaining = []
// value = true
```

## Path to Wasm

By default the wasm is loaded from the tupelo.wasm included in the npm package of this repo (src/js/go/tupelo.wasm) for node and from `/tupelo.wasm` (from the root of the server) in the browser.
This is customizable by setting Go.wasmPath equal to whever is better for your app.

## Building
In order to build this project, you first of all need to get the Git submodules:

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then install the dependencies and use the NPM 'build' script:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Running the tests

In order for the tests to run, you need to have a tupelo network running. In the directory [./wasmtupelo](./wasmtupelo) there is a docker-compose which will enable the tests.

``$ cd wasmtupelo && docker-compose up``

Then `npm test` should be green.
