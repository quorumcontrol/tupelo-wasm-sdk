# Tupelo WASM SDK

V2 of the tupelo-js-sdk is a standalone SDK that works with wasm to talk directly to the Tupelo network and does not require a rpc server.

Note: in the words of IPFS: this project is still in Alpha, lots of development is happening, API might change, beware of the Dragons üêâ..

## API
See: [https://quorumcontrol.github.io/tupelo-wasm-sdk/docs/tupelo-wasm-sdk.html](https://quorumcontrol.github.io/tupelo-wasm-sdk/docs/tupelo-wasm-sdk.html)

## Getting Started

The following snippet of code is all you need to send a transaction to our Testnet

```js
const sdk = require('tupelo-wasm-sdk')

// setup a connection to the default community and Tupelo TestNet
const community = await sdk.getDefault() 

// Generate a new public/private keypair
const key = await sdk.EcdsaKey.generate() 

// Create a new empty tree with the new keypair
const tree = await sdk.ChainTree.newEmptyTree(community.blockservice, key) 

// Play a transaction on the TestNet
let resp = await community.playTransactions(tree, [sdk.setDataTransaction("path", true)])

// Congrats on making a DLT transaction
```

You can also find ChainTrees by their DID and resolve data on them, easily:

```js
const sdk = require('tupelo-wasm-sdk')

// setup a connection to the default community and Tupelo TestNet
const community = await sdk.getDefault() 

const tip = await community.getTip("did:tupelo:0xD1a9826f3A06d393368C9949535De802A35cD6b2")

const tree = new ChainTree({
   store: community.blockservice,
   tip: tip,
})

const [remaining,value] = await tree.resolve(["tree", "data", "path"])

// remaining = []
// value = true

```

## Path to WASM

By default the wasm is loaded from the tupelo.wasm included in the npm package of this repo (src/js/go/tupelo.wasm) for node and from `/tupelo.wasm` (from the root of the server) in the browser.
This is customizable by setting Go.wasmPath equal to whever is better for your app.
